# chanscraper

Pretty simple tool to Download pictures within a 4chan or general imageboard thread.

usage is rather simple through the CLI:
  ```$ ./chanscraper <your Thread URL> <any custom directory that isn't home(not necessary)>```
By default if no download directory is given via the command arguments
your downloads will be saved at:
  /home/chanscrapes
  
  
keep in mind this is a very badly written tool and that if it wrecks your system like it did in the frst version to me it isn't my fault, you have been warned.
if you want to help me make it safer please do not hesitate to contact me at: xyresh996@gmail.com
