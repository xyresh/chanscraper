# chanscraper

Pretty simple tool to Download pictures within a 4chan or general imageboard thread.

usage is rather simple through the CLI:
  ```$ ./chanscraper <your Thread URL> <any custom directory that isn't home(not necessary)>```
By default if no download directory is given via the command arguments
your downloads will be saved at:
  /home/chanscrapes
